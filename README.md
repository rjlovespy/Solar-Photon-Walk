# Solar-Photon-Walk

This is a demonstration of an idea that any gamma ray photon which is produced inside the Sun's core due to proton-proton chain reaction during its thermonuclear fusion takes a simple-random walk(SRW) inside the interior of the Sun where the step size is very small as compared to the radius of the Sun.
