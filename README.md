# Solar-Photon-Walk

This is a demonstration of my idea that any gamma ray photon which is produced inside the Sun's core due to proton-proton chain reaction during its thermonuclear fusion takes:
1. a self-avoiding walk(SAW) inside the core of the Sun
2. a simple-random walk(SRW) inside the radiative zone of the Sun
3. a non-reversing random walk(NRRW) inside the convective zone of the Sun
provided the step size is very small as compared to the radius of the zone.
